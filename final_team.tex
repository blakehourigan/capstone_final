\section{Introduction\slash Executive Summary} 
\subsection{Introducing SoFab Inks}
SoFab Inks is a chemical manufacturing startup that was spun-out from the University of Louisville, Conn Center for Renewable Energy 
Research with support from the US DoE. SoFab inks focuses on accelerating the commercialization of Perovskite Solar Cells 
through the development and manufacturing of functionalized inks that improve cell efficiency, reduce module cost, and enable scalable 
manufacturing. \cite{sofabinks}
\subsection{SoFab Inks Inventory Management Problem}
SoFab Inks is doing important work in the field of solar cell technology, helping to drive humanity towards a cleaner, more energy 
abundant future. The problem, however, is that the team currently faces issues with managing inventory. These challenges prevent SoFab's
talented team from working on the most important aspects of their work. These challenges include expending valuable energy on menial 
tasks like locating inventory, managing a growing number of shipments manually, scouring inventory entries found across several 
Google Sheets or handwritten labels to pinpoint important product information, and more. 

To aid SoFab in these challenges, this semester Team 3 was tasked with developing a more efficient method of managing inventory items. 
To accomplish this, the team employed various existing software solutions, including database software, CRUD\footnote{Database term
for Create, Read, Update, Delete.} user interface software, and solutions to containerize this software together into one package. The 
team also developed custom software to provide features not available in the existing software solutions.

\section{System Description}
The following sections describe the specifications that were formulated as a result of communication between Team 3 and the SoFab Inks
team. 
\subsection{Needs Assessment\slash System Requirements}
Following assignment to this project, the team assembled and met virtually with the SoFab Inks team for brief self-introductions, 
an overview of the current issues facing SoFab, and to gain an initial insight of what the SoFab team was looking for in a
solution to these issues. 

The SoFab team described the current state of inventory management at the company which included problems such as shipments arriving 
to incorrect customers, an inability to pinpoint important information about products as they progressed through the manufacturing 
process, and difficult to track remaining volumes of chemical products. In these discussions, SoFab also emphasized the importance 
of a solution begin \textit{simple and easy-to-use}. As the team is primarily constructed of chemical engineers or business people, 
technology was not a strength. The company also made it clear that the ability to generate item labels for internal tracking of 
should be a priority. These labels would allow members of their team to easily scan a barcode to view the details of an item. Finally, 
it was also made clear that the company also desired the ability to generate shipment labels for their products as well. These labels 
would differ slightly from their internal tracking label counterparts with the inclusion of chemical hazard information. This information
would be included as a way to reduce harm for customers handling SoFab's chemicals upon receipt.

After this initial discussion, Team 3 began to brainstorm potential solutions to the problems presented. Immediately, 3 main 
pieces of software jumped out at the team as critical pieces to what would be the final product.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{A Database System} - In order to move the company away from the usage of Google Sheets and toward a more efficient, 
        safe and redundant, user-friendly solution, Team 3 knew it would be necessary to select an existing database software solution.
        While the team was unsure of what specific solution would be chosen, it was sure that one of these solutions would be required.
    \item \textbf{A User-Friendly Database Interface} - While a database solution would be an incredible improvement on its own, it 
        would be useless to the SoFab team if there were not a simple and easy way to interact with the underlying data. Again, the team
        was unsure of what specific solution would be chosen, but a few requirements from discussions with SoFab were clear. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Clean, Simple, Easy-to-Use} - As previously discussed, SoFab was clear that a simple and easy-to-use solution
                was of paramount importance for the day-to-day usage of the product. 
            \item \textbf{Free and Open-Source} - While this requirement was not mentioned in the initial discussions with SoFab, this 
                requirement jumped out as important to Team 3 because this would help to avoid incurring additional costs beyond the 
                development cost that SoFab had already paid. 
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Software to Generate Internal and Shipment Labels} - After discussing the need for barcode and label generation software,
        the team found that it would likely be necessary to build custom software to meet the needs of the client. The requirements were 
        quite specific, and would not be available in any existing commercial product. These requirements certainly would not be made 
        available in any \textit{free and open-source} software.
