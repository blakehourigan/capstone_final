\section{Introduction\slash Executive Summary} 
\subsection{Introducing SoFab Inks}
SoFab Inks is a chemical manufacturing startup that was spun-out from the University of Louisville, Conn Center for Renewable Energy 
Research with support from the US DoE. SoFab inks focuses on accelerating the commercialization of Perovskite Solar Cells 
through the development and manufacturing of functionalized inks that improve cell efficiency, reduce module cost, and enable scalable 
manufacturing. \cite{sofabinks}
\subsection{SoFab Inks Inventory Management Problem}
SoFab Inks is doing important work in the field of solar cell technology, helping to drive humanity towards a cleaner, more energy 
abundant future. The problem, however, is that the team currently faces issues with managing inventory. These challenges prevent SoFab's
talented team from working on the most important aspects of their work. These challenges include expending valuable energy on menial 
tasks like locating inventory, managing a growing number of shipments manually, scouring inventory entries found across several 
Google Sheets or handwritten labels to pinpoint important product information, and more. 

To aid SoFab in these challenges, this semester Team 3 was tasked with developing a more efficient method of managing inventory items. 
To accomplish this, the team employed various existing software solutions, including database software, CRUD\footnote{Database term
for Create, Read, Update, Delete.} user interface software, and soltutions to containerize this software together into one package. The 
team also developed custom software to provide features not available in the existing software solutions.

\section{System Description}
The following sections describe the specifications that were formulated as a result of communication between Team 3 and the SoFab inks
team. 
\subsection{Needs Assessment\slash System Requirements}
