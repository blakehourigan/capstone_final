\section{Introduction\slash Executive Summary} 
\subsection{Introducing SoFab Inks}
SoFab Inks is a chemical manufacturing startup that was spun-out from the University of Louisville, Conn Center for Renewable Energy 
Research with support from the US DoE. SoFab inks focuses on accelerating the commercialization of Perovskite Solar Cells 
through the development and manufacturing of functionalized inks that improve cell efficiency, reduce module cost, and enable scalable 
manufacturing. \cite{sofabinks}
\subsection{SoFab Inks Inventory Management Problem}
SoFab Inks is doing important work in the field of solar cell technology, helping to drive humanity towards a cleaner, more abundant
energy future.
